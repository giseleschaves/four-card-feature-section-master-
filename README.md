## My process

- 1. check the difference between mobile and desktop to create the hmtl structure
- 2. upload fonts, identify colors and where they should be aplied
- 2. implemented the changes between desktop and mobile orientation of the flex boxes
- 3. styled each area

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box

### What I learned

- Practice more about flex box as the design requires distinct orientations for each part of the page
- It is always better to implement the flexibility of the containers before styling the content

### Continued development

Now I think I'm ready to move on and get more dificult challenges

### Useful resources
